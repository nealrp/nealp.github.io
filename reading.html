							<h3>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life</h3>
							<h6>Mark Manson</h6>
						</header>
						<p>Key takeaway: "What do you give a F*ck about?" Decide that and all the decisions you make instantly become easier. Enjoyed the read and thought-provoking to analyze what you actually care about and what you don't. I'd like to read this again in a year or so and see how my priorities have changed. </p>

							<h3>Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future</h3>
							<h6>Ashlee Vance</h6>
						</header>
						<p>I've always been a fan of Musk. I've only grown into a bigger fan since reading this book about his story. There's part where you read in awe about the decisions he's made and the gambles associated with them. There's other part where you feel genuinely bad for him for the things he lost on in in life as part of the mission to keep Telsa and SpaceX afloat. Excited to continue to follow him and his work and see where it goes. Very much an attitude of "If no one is going to do it, I will" which I tremendously admire.</p>

							<h3>The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business</h3>
							<h6>Charles Duhigg</h6>
						</header>
						<p>One of the best books I've read in 2016. We all have bad habits. As someone who wishes to minimize those as much as possible, I took this book as a way to learn how to do that. Duhigg goes into why we do what we do and how we can take the same cues and change a bad habit into a good one. Will try to see if what he writes will work for me. </p>

							<h3>I Will Teach You to Be Rich</h3>
							<h6>Ramit Sethi</h6>
						</header>
						<p>As a recent grad with little experience with surplus income, this book is invaluable. It really forces you this think about life expenses you know are coming up and hel you better plan for them. Furthermore, brings the light of the question: "What does rich mean to you" Quick read and highly recommend. </p>

							<h3>Freakonomics</h3>
							<h6>Stephen J. Dubner and Steven Levitt</h6>
						</header>
						<p>One of the first books I read after I decided to pick up reading again. Great book consisting of short stories which result in conclusions you wouldn't expect. Very thought provoking.</p>
